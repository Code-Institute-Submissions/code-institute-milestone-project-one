Daryl Johnson is a fantastic all round engineer and an absolute joy to work with! His extensive experience and plethora of knowledge combined with his fantastic attitude and unmatched effort is incredibly refreshing!	
He provides a top of the range, high quality service, done with an exceptional turn around speed. If you want radio ready, professionally mixed songs that will make you sound as good as your favourite artists; my advice would be to message Daryl, he's your man!

Mike - Engineer for Pharrel Williams

Having known Daryl for many years, it was an easy choice for us to pick who would help us engineer our project. He was at all times, a true professional and went to great lengths to help us realise the sound in our heads we were searching for. A total pleasure to work with, we strongly recommend Daryl to bring your next record to life! Thanks again!
