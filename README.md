## Overview 

This site is aimed at making it incredibly simple for professional in the Music Industry to hire Daryl Johnson as their next mix or recording engineer. With efficient, stately UI choices preventing what would be a very crowded site otherwise, the user arrives on the lading page and instantly can fulfil their purpose for being there. The site, supplemented with Bootstrap, is completely responsive and behaves exactly as it should from large 1440x1044 displays to smaller mobile screens at 320x679.

## UI/UX

Having done market research on other freelance engineer sites, I found many of them cluttered, and too crammed with text and features, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. The landing page on my site is designed in a way to present exactly what the user would need to see; an image of the product (Daryl in this case), a CTA in a jumbotron to entice the user, and two buttons taking them to the most pertinent page of the site, maximising efficiency as much as possible. 

When choosing a style to pursue for this project, it felt natural to choose a subject that came pre-loaded with assets and content, rather than trying to procure my own. I chose to create a website for Daryl Johnson because, I wanted to try a different approach than my initial/simplest idea for the submission (which was a portfolio for my own web design career), and try to approach the project as if it was a real-world freelance situation. Daryl was extremely helpful and excited about the idea, and straight away sent me the assets that I ended up using as the Hero image for the landing page, and subsequent background images. 

I had already decided that I wanted to create a multi-page site, as I wanted to test myself for the first time in organising my directory files in GitPod. It was a welcome challenge from the simple sites I had made before to work with much larger amounts of code, and I endeavoured to use commenting in my HTML and CSS to split up areas and make it easier to read. I utilised Bootstrap for sections of this site as I find the class system incredibly intuitive, but I was cautious of leaning too heavily on their styling and used my own design ideas as much as possible to created a personal style. When speaking with Daryl (the 'client' in this case), he told me that a dark, bespoke UI was what he wanted, and I reflected this in the stately green primary colours, and header font (Roboto Slab). A site of this type, naturally has a lot of important information that needs to be conveyed, so to break up the text and stop cognitive overload, I used Bootstrap cards to separate blocks of text becoming too tiring to read.
